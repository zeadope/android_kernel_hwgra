+ * Emulate FPU instructions.

+ * If we use FPU hardware, then we have been typically called to handle
+ * an unimplemented operation, such as where an operand is a NaN or
+ * denormalized.  In that case exit the emulation loop after a single
+ * iteration so as to let hardware execute any subsequent instructions.
+ *
+ * If we have no FPU hardware or it has been disabled, then continue
+ * emulating floating-point instructions until one of these conditions
+ * has occurred:
+ *
+ * - a non-FPU instruction has been encountered,
+ *
+ * - an attempt to emulate has ended with a signal,
+ *
+ * - the ISA mode has been switched.
+ *
+ * We need to terminate the emulation loop if we got switched to the
+ * MIPS16 mode, whether supported or not, so that we do not attempt
+ * to emulate a MIPS16 instruction as a regular MIPS FPU instruction.
+ * Similarly if we got switched to the microMIPS mode and only the
+ * regular MIPS mode is supported, so that we do not attempt to emulate
+ * a microMIPS instruction as a regular MIPS FPU instruction.  Or if
+ * we got switched to the regular MIPS mode and only the microMIPS mode
+ * is supported, so that we do not attempt to emulate a regular MIPS
+ * instruction that should cause an Address Error exception instead.
+ * For simplicity we always terminate upon an ISA mode switch.
