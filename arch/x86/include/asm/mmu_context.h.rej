+		 * This logic has an ordering constraint:
+		 *
+		 *  CPU 0: Write to a PTE for 'next'
+		 *  CPU 0: load bit 1 in mm_cpumask.  if nonzero, send IPI.
+		 *  CPU 1: set bit 1 in next's mm_cpumask
+		 *  CPU 1: load from the PTE that CPU 0 writes (implicit)
+		 *
+		 * We need to prevent an outcome in which CPU 1 observes
+		 * the new PTE value and CPU 0 observes bit 1 clear in
+		 * mm_cpumask.  (If that occurs, then the IPI will never
+		 * be sent, and CPU 0's TLB will contain a stale entry.)
+		 *
+		 * The bad outcome can occur if either CPU's load is
+		 * reordered before that CPU's store, so both CPUs must
+		 * execute full barriers to prevent this from happening.
+		 *
+		 * Thus, switch_mm needs a full barrier between the
+		 * store to mm_cpumask and any operation that could load
+		 * from next->pgd.  TLB fills are special and can happen
+		 * due to instruction fetches or for no reason at all,
+		 * and neither LOCK nor MFENCE orders them.
+		 * Fortunately, load_cr3() is serializing and gives the
+		 * ordering guarantee we need.
