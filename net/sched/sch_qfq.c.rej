- * The index of the slot in which the aggregate is to be inserted must
- * not be higher than QFQ_MAX_SLOTS-2. There is a '-2' and not a '-1'
- * because the start time of the group may be moved backward by one
- * slot after the aggregate has been inserted, and this would cause
- * non-empty slots to be right-shifted by one position.
+ * The index of the slot in which the input aggregate agg is to be
+ * inserted must not be higher than QFQ_MAX_SLOTS-2. There is a '-2'
+ * and not a '-1' because the start time of the group may be moved
+ * backward by one slot after the aggregate has been inserted, and
+ * this would cause non-empty slots to be right-shifted by one
+ * position.
+ *
+ * QFQ+ fully satisfies this bound to the slot index if the parameters
+ * of the classes are not changed dynamically, and if QFQ+ never
+ * happens to postpone the service of agg unjustly, i.e., it never
+ * happens that the aggregate becomes backlogged and eligible, or just
+ * eligible, while an aggregate with a higher approximated finish time
+ * is being served. In particular, in this case QFQ+ guarantees that
+ * the timestamps of agg are low enough that the slot index is never
+ * higher than 2. Unfortunately, QFQ+ cannot provide the same
+ * guarantee if it happens to unjustly postpone the service of agg, or
+ * if the parameters of some class are changed.
+ *
+ * As for the first event, i.e., an out-of-order service, the
+ * upper bound to the slot index guaranteed by QFQ+ grows to
+ * 2 +
+ * QFQ_MAX_AGG_CLASSES * ((1<<QFQ_MTU_SHIFT)/QFQ_MIN_LMAX) *
+ * (current_max_weight/current_wsum) <= 2 + 8 * 128 * 1.
  *
- * If the weight and lmax (max_pkt_size) of the classes do not change,
- * then QFQ+ does meet the above contraint according to the current
- * values of its parameters. In fact, if the weight and lmax of the
- * classes do not change, then, from the theory, QFQ+ guarantees that
- * the slot index is never higher than
- * 2 + QFQ_MAX_AGG_CLASSES * ((1<<QFQ_MTU_SHIFT)/QFQ_MIN_LMAX) *
- * (QFQ_MAX_WEIGHT/QFQ_MAX_WSUM) = 2 + 8 * 128 * (1 / 64) = 18
+ * The following function deals with this problem by backward-shifting
+ * the timestamps of agg, if needed, so as to guarantee that the slot
+ * index is never higher than QFQ_MAX_SLOTS-2. This backward-shift may
+ * cause the service of other aggregates to be postponed, yet the
+ * worst-case guarantees of these aggregates are not violated.  In
+ * fact, in case of no out-of-order service, the timestamps of agg
+ * would have been even lower than they are after the backward shift,
+ * because QFQ+ would have guaranteed a maximum value equal to 2 for
+ * the slot index, and 2 < QFQ_MAX_SLOTS-2. Hence the aggregates whose
+ * service is postponed because of the backward-shift would have
+ * however waited for the service of agg before being served.
  *
- * When the weight of a class is increased or the lmax of the class is
- * decreased, a new aggregate with smaller slot size than the original
- * parent aggregate of the class may happen to be activated. The
- * activation of this aggregate should be properly delayed to when the
- * service of the class has finished in the ideal system tracked by
- * QFQ+. If the activation of the aggregate is not delayed to this
- * reference time instant, then this aggregate may be unjustly served
- * before other aggregates waiting for service. This may cause the
- * above bound to the slot index to be violated for some of these
- * unlucky aggregates.
+ * The other event that may cause the slot index to be higher than 2
+ * for agg is a recent change of the parameters of some class. If the
+ * weight of a class is increased or the lmax (max_pkt_size) of the
+ * class is decreased, then a new aggregate with smaller slot size
+ * than the original parent aggregate of the class may happen to be
+ * activated. The activation of this aggregate should be properly
+ * delayed to when the service of the class has finished in the ideal
+ * system tracked by QFQ+. If the activation of the aggregate is not
+ * delayed to this reference time instant, then this aggregate may be
+ * unjustly served before other aggregates waiting for service. This
+ * may cause the above bound to the slot index to be violated for some
+ * of these unlucky aggregates.
  *
  * Instead of delaying the activation of the new aggregate, which is
- * quite complex, the following inaccurate but simple solution is used:
- * if the slot index is higher than QFQ_MAX_SLOTS-2, then the
- * timestamps of the aggregate are shifted backward so as to let the
- * slot index become equal to QFQ_MAX_SLOTS-2.
+ * quite complex, the above-discussed capping of the slot index is
+ * used to handle also the consequences of a change of the parameters
+ * of a class.
