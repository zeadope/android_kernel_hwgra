+	 * Note that we can't bail out if the full sync flag isn't set. This is

+	 * value might be less than or equals to fs_info->last_trans_committed,
+	 * and setting a speculative last_trans for an inode when a buffered
+	 * write is made (such as fs_info->generation + 1 for example) would not
+	 * be reliable since after setting the value and before fsync is called
+	 * any number of transactions can start and commit (transaction kthread
+	 * commits the current transaction periodically), and a transaction
